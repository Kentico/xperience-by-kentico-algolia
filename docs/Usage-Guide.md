# Usage Guide

This library supports using Algolia.Search to index both unstructured and high structured, interrelated content in an Xperience by Kentico solution. This indexed content can then be programmatically queried and displayed in a website channel.

Below are the steps to integrate the library into your solution.

## Create a custom Indexing Strategy

See [Custom index strategy](Custom-index-strategy.md)

## Continuous Integration

When starting your application for the first time after adding this library to your solution, a custom module and custom module classes will automatically be created
to support managing search index configuration within the administration UI.

If you do not see new items added to your [CI repository](https://docs.xperience.io/x/FAKQC) for the new auto-generated Algolia search data types, stop your application and perform a [CI store](https://docs.xperience.io/xp/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration#ContinuousIntegration-Storeobjectdatatotherepository) to add the library's custom module configuration to the CI repository.

You should now be able to run a [CI restore](https://docs.xperience.io/xp/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration#ContinuousIntegration-Restorerepositoryfilestothedatabase).
Attempting to run a CI restore without the CI files in the CI repository will result in a SQL error during the restore.

When team members are merging changes that include the addition of this library, they _must_ first run a CI restore to ensure they have the same object metadata for the search custom module as your database.

Future updates to indexes will be tracked in the CI repository [unless they are excluded](https://docs.xperience.io/x/ygAcCQ).
